% PROJECTS
\section*{PROJECTS}
\noindent \textbf{Real-Time Object Detection and Tracking (Sponsored by Northrop Grumman):} Designed and developed a smart camera system capable of identifying, tracking, and following individuals wearing face masks. Implemented object detection through a pre-compiled face mask detection model and used OpenCV’s legacy MOSSE algorithm for facial recognition tracking. Created a C++/verilog module to convert coordinates into angles for precise movement and designed a proportional (P) controller for accurate camera positioning. Designed and assembled a circuit to interface with sensors and the control system. Researched and sourced components and thoroughly documented the development process for reports and presentations.\\
%\noindent \textbf{Autonomous Car:} Developed a model car capable of autonomously following a black line using a PID controller to adjust its direction and speed based on error correction. The car also features manual control through an IoT module (ESP32), accessible from any device with Wi-Fi. The hardware was built using C programming on an MSP430 microcontroller, a FET board, an ESP32 module, an IR LED sensor, and a custom-designed display board from PCB schematics.

\noindent \textbf{Apple Stock Prediction:} Automated stock technical analysis through a neural network model in Python, focusing on predicting the future prices of Apple stocks and making stock investing easier without requiring extensive research. Using historical stock data, developed a baseline recurrent neural network with a simple RNN layer, achieving a root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.085. Enhanced accuracy by integrating long short-term memory (LSTM) layers, significantly improving the model’s performance and reducing the RMSE to 1.962. 

%\noindent \textbf{Simple CPU:} Designed a 16-bit CPU using Verilog, capable of performing various arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, and exponentiation. Programmed an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) with the necessary opcodes and developed a control unit, data path, and register file to facilitate these operations. This project showcased my ability to design and implement fundamental CPU components from scratch.
