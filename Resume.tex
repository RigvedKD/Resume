% PROJECTS
\section*{Projects}
\noindent \textbf{Real-Time Object Detection and Tracking (Sponsored by Northrop Grumman):}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=0pt,topsep=0pt]
    \item Designed and created a smart camera to identify, track, and follow someone wearing a facemask using AMD Xilinx’s KV260 development board.
    \item Developed object detection using a pre-compiled facemask detection model from Xilinx’s Model Zoo.
    \item Utilized OpenCV’s legacy MOSSE algorithm for object tracking, processed through a proportional-only controller.
    \item Created a module to convert coordinates into angles for precise movement.
    \item Implemented a proportional (P) controller for correct camera positioning.
    \item Designed and assembled a circuit to interface with sensors and control system.
    \item Researched and sourced components, including a servo controller.
    \item Documented the development process, created reports, and presented the project outcomes.
\end{itemize}
\noindent \textbf{Autonomous Car:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=0pt,topsep=0pt]
    \item Created a model car that follows a black line using a PID controller to adjust direction and speed based on error.
    \item Designed the car to be manually controlled using an IoT module (ESP32) and any device with Wi-Fi.
    \item The car was built using C, a MSP430, a FET board, an ESP32, a IR LED sensor, and a display board designed from PCB schematics.
\end{itemize}
\noindent \textbf{Apple Stock Prediction:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=0pt,topsep=0pt]
    \item Developed a neural network model to automate stock technical analysis, reducing the time and expertise required.
    \item Utilized historical Apple stock data to predict future prices, focusing on the closing price.
    \item Implemented a baseline recurrent neural network with a simple RNN layer, achieving a root mean square error of 4.085, later enhanced with long short-term memory for accuracy.
    \item Achieved a root mean square error of 1.962, significantly improving the baseline.
\end{itemize}
\noindent \textbf{Simple CPU:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=0pt,topsep=0pt]
    \item Using Verilog, created a 16-bit CPU capable of performing arithmetic calculations like add, subtract, multiply, divide, modulo, and exponents.
    \item Programmed an ALU with necessary opcodes.
    \item Designed and programmed a control unit, data path, and register file.
\end{itemize}
